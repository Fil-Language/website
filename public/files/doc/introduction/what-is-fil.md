# What is fil?

The initial contributor of this project is [Kevin Traini](https://ktraini.com) (me, I am currently typing those lines).
The first idea come during my 2nd year in computer science studies. At this time I was learning many languages with
several paradigm: mainly imperative, functional and object-oriented.

While learning OCaml to put in practice functional paradigm (and later in studies it was Haskell) I really liked the
challenge of working with simple data-structures and functions. But the syntax of OCaml and Haskell is pretty
restrictive and some things I was able to do in other languages was a real pity in functional.

Each language I learned have strong points I really liked and some not. It's from all of this that I decided to create
my own languages with all the points I liked.

The speech at the start was pretty easy: a functional language with which I can manipulate object and keep a strong
typing. In brief merging OCaml, Ada and Kotlin. With this idea I began to work with my favourite language of this time:
C++.

After some years at developing pretty nothing like described in [FDR 000](/FDR/000%20-%20Introduction%20to%20FDR). I choose to
redefined completely the language without losing the first idea.

## So, what is fil?

Fil (it means Fil Is a Language ðŸ¤˜) is language belonging to functional paradigm.

In this language everything is an expression. Loops, conditions, functions, data structures, variable declaration are
all expressions and returns a value. It's your choice to use this value or not.

## What is the goal?

The goal is simply to be simple. You can write what you want in fil from a tiny cli to a complete software.

The project aims to provide to the developers all the tools needed to write code easily: a compiler with meaningful
messages, a project manager to manage your dependencies, a complete standard library (you need something it is in it)
and finally a package manager with a registry to let everyone share their projects.
